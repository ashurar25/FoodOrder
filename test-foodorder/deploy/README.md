## Quick Deploy

### 1. Render (Recommended - Free Tier Available)

```bash
# Connect your GitHub repository to Render
# Use the render.yaml file for automatic configuration
```

**Steps:**
1. Connect GitHub repo to Render
2. The `render.yaml` file will automatically configure the service
3. Set environment variables: `NODE_ENV=production`
4. Deploy! ðŸš€

- Error handling and logging

## Deployment Files

- `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build for production
- `docker-compose.yml` - Local development and production
- `nginx.conf` - Reverse proxy configuration
- `render.yaml` - Render.com configuration
- `railway.json` - Railway.app configuration
- `heroku.yml` - Heroku container deployment
- `fly.toml` - Fly.io configuration

## Database

The application uses a file-based JSON database (`server/data/database.json`) which includes:
- Restaurant information
- Menu categories and food items
- Orders and order history
- Theme settings (mint theme)
- Banner configurations

This makes deployment simple as no external database setup is required.

## Monitoring and Health Checks

All deployment configurations include health checks on `/api/restaurant` endpoint to ensure the application is running properly.

## Support

For deployment issues, check the logs in your chosen platform or run locally with Docker to debug.
